  abstract: 'Yield gap analysis results at country level for rainfed wheat, as determined
    by the Global Yield Gap Atlas project. Four yield indicators are available: Absolute
    Yg, Relative Yg, Ya and Yw. For rainfed crops the yield gap (Yg) is defined as
    the difference between the actual yield (Ya) and the simulated water limited yield
    potential (Yw). So Yw - Ya. The default style is ''WheatAbsoluteYieldGap'', ''RelativeYieldGap''
    is offered as an alternative.Yw can be viewed by choosing the style ''WaterLimitedYieldPotentialWheat''.
    And for Ya please select the style ''ActualYieldWheat''. More information is available
    at  the website www.yieldgap.org.'

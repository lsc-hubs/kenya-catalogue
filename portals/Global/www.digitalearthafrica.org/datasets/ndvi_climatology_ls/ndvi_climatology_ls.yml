  abstract: 'Standardised NDVI Anomalies provide a measure of vegetation health relative
    to long term average conditions by measuring the departure, in units of standard
    devaiations, away from the long-term average. These NDVI climatologies (both mean
    and standard deviation) represent the long-term average baseline conditions of
    vegetation condition.


    NDVI climatologies are available for each month at a spatial resolution of 30
    m, and were calculated by aggregating data from 1984-2020.


    More technical information about the NDVI Anomaly service can be found in the
    User Guide (https://docs.digitalearthafrica.org/en/latest/data_specs/NDVI_Climatology_specs.html)


    This service is accessible through OGC Web Service (https://ows.digitalearth.africa/),
    for analysis in DE Africa Sandbox JupyterLab (https://github.com/digitalearthafrica/deafrica-sandbox-notebooks/wiki)
    and for direct download click on a tile in the explorer page (https://explorer.digitalearth.africa/products/ndvi_climatology_ls)'

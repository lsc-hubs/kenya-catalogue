  abstract: 'The Global Mangrove Watch (GMW) aims to provide geospatial information
    about mangrove extent and changes to the Ramsar Convention, national wetland practitioners,
    decision makers and NGOs. It is part of the Ramsar Science and Technical Review
    Panel (STRP) work plan for 2016-2018 and a Pilot Project to the Ramsar Global
    Wetlands Observation System (GWOS), which is implemented under the GEO-Wetlands
    Initiative. The primary objective of the GMW has been to provide countries lacking
    a national mangrove monitoring system with first cut mangrove extent and change
    maps, to help safeguard against further mangrove forest loss and degradation.


    DE Africa provides access to GMW mangrove extent data over Africa. This dataset
    is available for the years 1996, 2007, 2008, 2009, 2010, 2015, and 2016. The extents
    have been rasterized to a spatial resolution of 0.0002 deg (~22 m).

  abstract: "Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data have been shown to provide different\
    \ and complementary information to the more common optical remote sensing data.\
    \ Radar backscatter response is a function of topography, land cover structure,\
    \ orientation, and moisture characteristics\u2014including vegetation biomass\u2014\
    and the radar signal can penetrate clouds, providing information about the earth\u2019\
    s surface where optical sensors cannot. Digital Earth Africa provides access to\
    \ Normalized Radar Backscatter data, for which Radiometric Terrain Correction\
    \ (RTC) has been applied so data acquired with different imaging geometries over\
    \ the same region can be compared.\n\nThe twin Sentinel-1 satellites, launched\
    \ in 2014 and 2016, are operated by the European Space Agency (ESA) as part of\
    \ European Commission's Copernicus Programme. They currently collects C-band SAR\
    \ data every 6 to 12 days over Africa.\n\nThis product contains radar measurement\
    \ in C-band and in VV and VH polarizations. It has a spatial resolution of approximate\
    \ 20 m, a temporal coverage of July 2018 to current and is updated as new images\
    \ are acquired. Data is provided as Gamma0 in linear power, which can be converted\
    \ to backscatter in decibel unit using 10*log10(DN).\n\nThis dataset is processed\
    \ by Sinergise Sentinel Hub using Sentinel-1 GRD product provided by ESA as input.\
    \ RTC has been calcuated using 30 m Copernicus Digital Elevation Model.\n\nMore\
    \ techincal information about the Sentinel-1 Normalized Backscatter can be found\
    \ in the User Guide (https://docs.digitalearthafrica.org/en/latest/data_specs/Sentinel-1_specs.html)\n\
    \nThis product is accessible through OGC Web Service (https://ows.digitalearth.africa/),\
    \ for analysis in DE Africa Sandbox JupyterLab (https://github.com/digitalearthafrica/deafrica-sandbox-notebooks/wiki)\
    \ and for direct download from AWS S3 (https://data.digitalearth.africa/)."

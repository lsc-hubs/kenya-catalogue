  abstract: 'Fractional cover provides information about the proportions of green
    vegetation, non-green vegetation (including deciduous trees during autumn, dry
    grass, etc.), and bare soil for every 30 m x 30 m ground footprint. Fractional
    cover provides insight into how areas of dry vegetation and/or bare soil and green
    vegetation are changing over time. The percentile summaries are designed to make
    it easier to analyse and interpret fractional cover. Percentiles provide an indicator
    of where an observation sits, relative to the rest of the observations for the
    pixel. For example, the 90th percentile is the value below which 90% of the observations
    fall.


    Each annual summary contains the 10th, 50th, and 90th percentiles estimated independently
    for the green vegetation, non-green vegetation, and bare fractions observed in
    a calendar year. It provides robust estimates of the lowest, median, and highest
    proportion values observed for each cover type, which can be used to characterise
    the land cover. The annual summaries are available from 1984 to the most recent
    full calendar year.


    The fractional cover algorithm was developed by the Joint Remote Sensing Research
    Program. Before the percentile calculation, areas of water and cloud cover, as
    mapped in the Water Observations from Space (WOfS) Feature Layer, are excluded.'

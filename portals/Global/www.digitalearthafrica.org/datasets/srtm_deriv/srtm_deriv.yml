  abstract: "Derivative products of a Digital Elevation Model (DEM) can be used to\
    \ better understand the Earth's topography and model illumination, geometry, and\
    \ aspect. DE Africa provides three Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) derivative\
    \ products:\n\n - Slope: rate of elevation change, expressed as a percentage\n\
    \ - Multi-resolution Valley Bottom Flatness (MrVBF): topographic index used to\
    \ identify valley bottoms, which are useful for hydrological and sedimentation\
    \ modelling. In this product, 0 indicates areas which are not valley bottom areas,\
    \ while 1 - 7 indicate increasingly flatter and larger valley bottoms\n - Multi-resolution\
    \ Ridge Top Flatness (MrRTF): topographic index used for landform classification.\
    \ It uses a scale of 0 - 7 inclusive; 0 indicates steep or low locations while\
    \ 1 - 7 indicate increasingly larger areas of high flat land\n\nThe latter two\
    \ identify the dominant nature of the topography as either ridge-like or valley-like\
    \ (Gallant and Dowling, 2003).\n\nThese derivative products have a spatial resolution\
    \ of 30 m and are derived from data collected by NASA's Shuttle Radar Topography\
    \ Mission in 2000.\n\nSRTM data is provided by NASA's Land Processes Distributed\
    \ Active Archive Center (LP DAAC).\n\nFor more information on SRTM, see https://lpdaac.usgs.gov/products/srtmgl1v003/\n\
    For more information on generating the derivative product, see https://github.com/digitalearthafrica/dem-derivative\n\
    \nThis product is accessible through OGC Web Service (https://ows.digitalearth.africa/),\
    \ for analysis in DE Africa Sandbox JupyterLab (https://github.com/digitalearthafrica/deafrica-sandbox-notebooks/wiki)."

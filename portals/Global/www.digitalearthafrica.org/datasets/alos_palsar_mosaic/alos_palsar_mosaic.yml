  abstract: "Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data have been shown to provide different\
    \ and complementary information to the more common optical remote sensing data.\
    \ Radar backscatter response is a function of topography, land cover structure,\
    \ orientation, and moisture characteristics\u2014including vegetation biomass\u2014\
    and the radar signal can penetrate clouds, providing information about the earth\u2019\
    s surface where optical sensors cannot. Digital Earth Africa provides access to\
    \ Normalized Radar Backscatter data, for which Radiometric Terrain Correction\
    \ (RTC) has been applied so data acquired with different imaging geometries over\
    \ the same region can be compared.\n\nThe ALOS/PALSAR annual mosaic is a global\
    \ 25 m resolution dataset that combines data from many images captured by JAXA's\
    \ PALSAR and PALSAR-2 sensors on ALOS-1 and ALOS-2 satellites respectively.\n\n\
    This product contains radar measurement in L-band and in HH and HV polarizations.\
    \ It has a spatial resolution of 25 m and is available annually for 2007 to 2010\
    \ (ALOS/PALSAR) and 2015 to 2018 (ALOS-2/PALSAR-2). Data is provided as digital\
    \ number (DN), which can be converted to backscatter in decibel unit using 10*log10(\U0001D437\
    \U0001D441^2)-83.0.\n\nIt is part of a global dataset provided by the Japan Aerospace\
    \ Exploration Agency (JAXA) Earth Observation Research Center.\n\nFor more information\
    \ on the product, see https://www.eorc.jaxa.jp/ALOS/en/palsar_fnf/fnf_index.htm\n\
    \nThis product is accessible through OGC Web Service (https://ows.digitalearth.africa/),\
    \ for analysis in DE Africa Sandbox JupyterLab (https://github.com/digitalearthafrica/deafrica-sandbox-notebooks/wiki)\
    \ and for direct download from AWS S3 (https://data.digitalearth.africa/)."

  abstract: 'Water Observations from Space (WOfS) provides surface water observations
    derived from satellite imagery for all of Africa. The WOfS product allows users
    to get a better understanding of where water is normally present in a landscape,
    where water is seldom observed, and where inundation has occurred occasionally.
    Data is provided as Water Observation Feature Layers (WOFLs), in a 1 to 1 relationship
    with the input satellite data. Hence there is one WOFL for each satellite dataset
    processed for the occurrence of water.


    This product has a spatial resolution of 30 m and a temporal coverage of 1980s
    to current.


    It is derived from Landsat Collection 2 surface reflectance product.


    Daily water observations can be used to map historical flood and to understand
    surface water dynamics.


    WOfS shows surface water on the day and time that satellite passed overhead, which
    might be before, during or after a flood peak. Given the time between satellite
    passes (approximately once every 16 days) it is unlikely that the satellite will
    capture the maximum extent of any given flood. Instead, it aims to provide large
    scale, regional information on surface water.

    This product is accessible through OGC Web Service (https://ows.digitalearth.africa/)

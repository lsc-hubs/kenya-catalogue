  abstract: 'Yield gap analysis results at country level for irrigated rice, as determined
    by the Global Yield Gap Atlas project. Four yield indicators are available: Absolute
    Yg, Relative Yg, Ya and Yw. For irrigated crops the yield gap (Yg) is defined
    as the difference between the actual yield (Ya) and the simulated potential yield
    (Yp). So Yp - Ya. The default style is ''AbsoluteYieldGap'', ''RelativeYieldGap''
    is offered as an alternative. Yp can be viewed by choosing the style ''PotentialYield''.
    And for Ya please select the style ''ActualYield''. More information is available
    at  the website www.yieldgap.org.'

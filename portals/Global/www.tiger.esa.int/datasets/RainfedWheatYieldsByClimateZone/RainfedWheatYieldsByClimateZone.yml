  abstract: 'Yield gap analysis results at climate zone level for rainfed wheat, as
    determined by the Global Yield Gap Atlas project. Four yield indicators are available:
    Absolute Yg, Relative Yg, Ya and Yw. For rainfed crops the yield gap (Yg) is defined
    as the difference between the actual yield (Ya) and the simulated water limited
    yield potential (Yw). So Yw - Ya. The default style is ''WheatAbsoluteYieldGap'',
    ''RelativeYieldGap'' is offered as an alternative. Yw can be viewed by choosing
    the style ''WaterLimitedYieldPotentialWheat''. And for Ya please select the style
    ''ActualYieldWheat''. More information is available at  the website www.yieldgap.org.'

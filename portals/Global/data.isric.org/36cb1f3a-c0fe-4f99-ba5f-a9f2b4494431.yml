  title: Global distribution of soil phosphorus retention potential
  abstract: "Limited availability of P in soils to crops may be due to deficiency\
    \ and/or severe P retention. Earlier studies that drew on large soil profile databases\
    \ have indicated that it is not (yet) feasible to present meaningful values for\
    \ \u201Cplant-available\u201D soil P, obtained according to comparable analytical\
    \ methods, that may be linked to soil geographical databases derived from 1:5\
    \ million scale FAO Digital Soil Map of the World, such as the 5 x 5 arc-minute\
    \ version of the ISRIC-WISE database. Therefore, an alternative solution for studying\
    \ possible crop responses to fertilizer-P applied to soils, at a broad scale,\
    \ was sought. The approach described in this report considers the inherent capacity\
    \ of soils to retain phosphorus (P retention), in various forms. Main controlling\
    \ factors of P retention processes, at the broad scale under consideration, are\
    \ considered to be pH, soil mineralogy, and clay content. First, derived values\
    \ for these properties were used to rate the inferred capacity for P retention\
    \ of the component soil units of each map unit (or grid cell) using four classes\
    \ (i.e., Low, Moderate, High, and Very High). Subsequently, the overall soil phosphorus\
    \ retention potential was assessed for each mapping unit, taking into account\
    \ the P-ratings and relative proportion of each component soil unit. Each P retention\
    \ class has been assigned to a likely fertilizer P recovery fraction, derived\
    \ from the literature, thereby permitting spatially more detailed, integrated\
    \ model-based studies of environmental sustainability and agricultural production\
    \ at the global and continental level (< 1:5 million). Nonetheless, uncertainties\
    \ remain high; the present analysis provides an approximation of world soil phosphorus\
    \ retention potential."

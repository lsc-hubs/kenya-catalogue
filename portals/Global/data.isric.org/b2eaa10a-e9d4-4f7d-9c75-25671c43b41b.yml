  title: WoSIS latest - Bulk density fine earth - 33 kPa
  abstract: "Bulk density of the fine earth fraction*, equilibrated at 33 kPa (kg/dm\xB3\
    ).\n       \nISRIC is developing a centralized and user\u2013focused server database,\
    \ known as ISRIC World Soil Information Service (WoSIS). The aims are to: \n\u2022\
    \ Safeguard world soil data \"as is\" \n\u2022 Share soil point (i.e. profile)\
    \ data upon their standardization, and ultimately harmonization \n\u2022 Provide\
    \ quality-assessed, geo-referenced soil data for a growing range of environmental\
    \ applications (e.g. SoilGrids250m). \n\nThe number of measured data for each\
    \ property varies between pro\uFB01les and with depth, generally depending on\
    \ the purpose of the initial studies. Further, in most source data sets, there\
    \ are fewer data for soil physical as opposed to soil chemical attributes and\
    \ there are fewer measurements for deeper than for superficial horizons. Generally,\
    \ limited quality information is associated with the various source data. \n\n\
    Further information is provided in a https://doi.org/10.5194/essd-12-299-2020\
    \ and https://www.isric.org/sites/default/files/WOSISprocedureManual_2020nov17web.pdf.\n\
    \n* The fine earth fraction is generally defined as being less than 2 mm. However,\
    \ an upper limit of 1 mm was used in the former Soviet Union  and its sattelite\
    \ states (Katchynsky scheme). This has been indicated in the database."

  title: WoSIS latest - Bulk density fine earth - air dry
  abstract: "Bulk density of the fine earth fraction*, air dried (kg/dm\xB3).\n  \
    \     \nISRIC is developing a centralized and user\u2013focused server database,\
    \ known as ISRIC World Soil Information Service (WoSIS). The aims are to: \n\u2022\
    \ Safeguard world soil data \"as is\" \n\u2022 Share soil point (i.e. profile)\
    \ data upon their standardization, and ultimately harmonization \n\u2022 Provide\
    \ quality-assessed, geo-referenced soil data for a growing range of environmental\
    \ applications (e.g. SoilGrids250m). \n\nAt present, wosis_latest contains standardized\
    \ data for 217,000 profiles. The number of measured data for each property varies\
    \ between pro\uFB01les and with depth, generally depending on the purpose of the\
    \ initial studies. Further, in most source data sets, there are fewer data for\
    \ soil physical as opposed to soil chemical attributes and there are fewer measurements\
    \ for deeper than for superficial horizons. Generally, limited quality information\
    \ is associated with the various source data. \n\nFurther information is provided\
    \ in a https://doi.org/10.5194/essd-12-299-2020 and https://www.isric.org/sites/default/files/WOSISprocedureManual_2020nov17web.pdf.\n\
    \n* The fine earth fraction is generally defined as being less than 2 mm. However,\
    \ an upper limit of 1 mm was used in the former Soviet Union  and its sattelite\
    \ states (Katchynsky scheme). This has been indicated in the database."

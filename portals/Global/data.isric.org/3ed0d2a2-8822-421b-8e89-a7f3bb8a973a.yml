  title: WoSIS latest - Effective cation exchange capacity - ISRIC
  abstract: "Capacity of the fine earth fraction* to hold exchangeable cations at\
    \ the pH of the soil (ECEC). Conventionally approximated by summation of exchangeable\
    \ bases (Ca2+, Mg2+, K+, and Na+) plus 1 N KCl exchangeable acidity (Al3+ and\
    \ H+) in acidic soils (cmol(c)/kg).\n       \nISRIC is developing a centralized\
    \ and user\u2013focused server database, known as ISRIC World Soil Information\
    \ Service (WoSIS). The aims are to: \n\u2022 Safeguard world soil data \"as is\"\
    \ \n\u2022 Share soil point (i.e. profile) data upon their standardization, and\
    \ ultimately harmonization \n\u2022 Provide quality-assessed, geo-referenced soil\
    \ data for a growing range of environmental applications (e.g. SoilGrids250m).\
    \ \n\nAt present, wosis_latest contains standardized data for 217,000 profiles.\
    \ The number of measured data for each property varies between pro\uFB01les and\
    \ with depth, generally depending on the purpose of the initial studies. Further,\
    \ in most source data sets, there are fewer data for soil physical as opposed\
    \ to soil chemical attributes and there are fewer measurements for deeper than\
    \ for superficial horizons. Generally, limited quality information is associated\
    \ with the various source data. Further information is provided in  https://doi.org/10.5194/essd-12-299-2020\
    \ and https://www.isric.org/sites/default/files/WOSISprocedureManual_2020nov17web.pdf.\n\
    \n* The fine earth fraction is generally defined as being less than 2 mm. However,\
    \ an upper limit of 1 mm was used in the former Soviet Union  and its satellite\
    \ states (Katchynsky scheme). This has been indicated in the database."

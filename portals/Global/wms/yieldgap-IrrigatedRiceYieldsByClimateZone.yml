  title: IrrigatedRiceYieldsByClimateZone
  abstract: 'Yield gap analysis results at climate zone level for irrigated rice,
    as determined by the Global Yield Gap Atlas project. Four yield indicators are
    available: Absolute Yg, Relative Yg, Ya and Yw. For irrigated crops the yield
    gap (Yg) is defined as the difference between the actual yield (Ya) and the simulated
    potential yield (Yp). So Yp - Ya. The default style is ''AbsoluteYieldGap'', ''RelativeYieldGap''
    is offered as an alternative. Yp can be viewed by choosing the style ''PotentialYield''.
    And for Ya please select the style ''ActualYield''. More information is available
    at  the website www.yieldgap.org.'

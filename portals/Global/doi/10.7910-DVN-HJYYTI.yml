  title: Agro-ecological Zones of Africa
  abstract: 'Agroecological zones (AEZs) are geographical areas exhibiting similar
    climatic conditions that determine their ability to support rainfed agriculture.
    At a regional scale, AEZs are influenced by latitude, elevation, and temperature,
    as well as seasonality, and rainfall amounts and distribution during the growing
    season. The resulting AEZ classifications for Africa have three dimensions: major
    climate zone (tropics or subtropics), moisture zones (water availability) and
    highland/lowland (warm or cool based on elevation).'

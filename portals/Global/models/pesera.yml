  title: Pan-European soil erosion risk assessment, The PESERA map
  abstract: "Soil erosion is a natural process, occurring over geologic time, and\
    \ indeed it is a process \nthat is essential for soil formation. \nIn the context\
    \ of environmental protection, most concerns about erosion are related to \naccelerated\
    \ erosion, where the natural rate has been significantly increased mostly by \n\
    human activity. Accelerated erosion by running water has been identified as the\
    \ most \nsevere threat to soil in Europe. \nSevere erosion is commonly associated\
    \ with the development of temporary or permanently \neroded channels or gullies\
    \ that can fragment farmland. Such features are often the only \nvisible signs.\
    \ \nIn a period of rapid change in both climate and land use, and/or in response\
    \ to revised \nagricultural policies and international markets, it is very important\
    \ to be able to assess the \nstate of soil erosion at a European level, using\
    \ an objective methodology. \nThis report is to accompany Special Publication\
    \ Ispra 2004 No.73 \u2013 S.P.I.04.73, The \nPESERA Map version 1 October 2003,\
    \ in ISO B1 format. \nThe PESERA map shows estimated loss of soil by water erosion\
    \ and it is one of the key \noutputs from the PESERA research project. \nThe map\
    \ is based on the application, at 1 km resolution, of the PESERA/RDI model that\
    \ \nestimates the rate of loss of soil material from hillsides. \nOther forms\
    \ of soil erosion caused by wind, snowmelt, undercutting of river-banks, tillage,\
    \ \ntrampling by animals, land-levelling and landslides are not included. \nThere\
    \ are several possible methodologies for creating an erosion map of Europe; some\
    \ of \nthese are based on the collection of distributed field observations, others\
    \ on an assessment \nof factors and combinations of factors that influence erosion\
    \ rates, and others primarily on \na modelling approach. \nAll of these methods\
    \ require calibration and validation, although the type of validation \nneeded\
    \ is different for each category. \nThe PESERA (Pan\u2013European Soil Erosion\
    \ Risk Assessment) model is a physically based \nand spatial distributed model\
    \ combining the effect of topography, climate and soil into a \nsingle integrated\
    \ forecast of runoff and soil erosion. \nPESERA uses the simplest possible storage,\
    \ or \u2018bucket\u2019 model to convert daily rainfall to \ndaily overland flow\
    \ runoff. Runoff is estimated as Rainfall minus Threshold storage. The \nthreshold\
    \ depends on a number of factors related to the soil, vegetation cover, tillage\
    \ and \nsoil moisture status. \nThe calculations described above are performed\
    \ independently for each cell within a 1 km \ngrid across Europe. \nA pan-European\
    \ calibration of erosion rates is not practicable because there are only a \n\
    limited number (between 50 and 100) of sites, throughout Europe, where acceptable\
    \ \nmeasurements of erosion rates have been made and these differ significantly\
    \ in \nmethodology and scale.  Four main datasets are required to run the PESERA\
    \ model, to provide essential climate, \nsoils, land cover and topographic data.\
    \ \nThe MARS database (JRC) provides daily time series of rainfall, temperature\
    \ and potential \nevapotranspiration, interpolated to a 50 km grid for Europe.\
    \ These data have been further \ninterpolated at 1 km resolution, using a inverse-spline\
    \ mathematical procedure, to provide \nthe monthly data layers for the model.\
    \ \nThe European Soil Database has been used to provide soil erodibility (converts\
    \ runoff to \nerosion rates), soil water storage capacity (maximum storage capacity\
    \ of the soil before \nrunoff) and crustability (sets the lower limit of storage\
    \ capacity for a crusted soil in \nunvegetated areas), on a consistent basis at\
    \ 1 km resolution across Europe. \nLand use is based on CORINE land cover at 250\
    \ m resolution for 1989, and these data are \ncombined with cereal planting dates\
    \ to provide the parameters for a crop or natural \nvegetation growth model. \n\
    A 30 second (1 km) digital elevation model available from EROS has provided the\
    \ \ntopographic basis for the PESERA erosion map. \nThe PESERA model has been\
    \ applied at a 1 km resolution for the whole of Europe except \nfor some areas\
    \ where some data are missing.  For Denmark, the PESERA map shows erosion rates\
    \ that seem to be high compared with \nsouthern Europe, and appear not to be related\
    \ to planting dates or to crop cover.  The map shows erosion rates east of Bayonne\
    \ that seem quite high compared to other \nlandscape units in France and Spain,\
    \ whereas for other areas in France the erosion \nestimates seem to fit better\
    \ with local observation and/or expert judgement. \nEstimated erosion rates are\
    \ shown to be high in the northern part of the Po valley in Italy, \ndespite the\
    \ fact that the land is relatively flat. In the arable areas of Umbria, Le Marche,\
    \ \nCampagne and Molise, the predicted erosion rates accord much better with observation.\
    \ \nIn Spain, except for the valley of the Guadalquivir and to a lesser extent\
    \ on the northern \nMeseta, areas of high erosion are mostly small and localised\
    \ with predicted soil loss rates \nin the rest of the country probably being underestimates.\
    \ \nThe PESERA map probably underestimates erosion rates on the silty soils in\
    \ the Welsh \nBorderlands (UK), and on some parts of the South Downs in southern\
    \ England, but \nrevision of the land use/cover and the climate (rainfall) data\
    \ might correct this. \nAlthough in general it seems as if the current version\
    \ of the PESERA grid model may over estimate erosion in valleys and basins where\
    \ the land is arable but relatively flat, many \nareas on the map show erosion\
    \ rates coinciding with observation and measurement, for \nexample parts of the\
    \ Guadalquivir and Ebro valleys in Spain, around Toulouse in southwest France,\
    \ the loess belt in Belgium, the Siret catchment in north-eastern Romania, the\
    \ \nAlto-Adige (I), agricultural areas in Czech Republic and much of Slovakia.\
    \ \nIn practice, no erosion map at a European scale can be based on detailed knowledge\
    \ at \nevery point on the continent and it would be impossible to include every\
    \ factor of local \nimportance in a comprehensive model. \nThe greatest potential\
    \ for improvement in these erosion estimates from PESERA version 1, \nlies in\
    \ the use of better climate data, potentially available from national archives\
    \ though not \nnormally free of charge, more detailed soil information and up-to-date\
    \ land use/cover. \nLand cover requires frequent updating, because changes in\
    \ land use have a major impact \non erosion rates. There is the potential to do\
    \ this through the analysis of remotely sensed \nimages. For future scenarios\
    \ of erosion, improvements in GCMs and economic forecasts \noffer a potential\
    \ that is still far from full realisation. \nHowever, by applying a common methodology\
    \ throughout Europe, based on physical \nunderstanding, the PESERA model is able\
    \ to identify major differences between regions \nand to highlight areas particularly\
    \ at risk. \nTo date, PESERA provides the only Europe-wide estimates of soil erosion\
    \ by water, that \nare based on a harmonised approach and standard data sets.\
    \ This first version of the \nPESERA map is therefore timely in its appearance\
    \ and should provide the initial basis for \nplanning policies to protect soil\
    \ at the European level. \nThe possibilities for improvement in the near future\
    \ look optimistic in view of the vastly \nimproved data on land use and cover\
    \ together with enhanced data processing capabilities \nthat are now becoming\
    \ available. \nThe next step will be to compare the PESERA estimates with national\
    \ measurements and \nrisk assessments. Combining the results of such comparisons\
    \ with improved data on \nclimate, soil, land use/cover and topography (DEM) should\
    \ lead to improved estimates of \nsoil erosion by water for input to the forthcoming\
    \ soil protection strategy for Europe. \n"

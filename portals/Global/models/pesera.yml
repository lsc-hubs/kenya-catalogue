  title: Pan-European soil erosion risk assessment: The PESERA map
  abstract:|
    Soil erosion is a natural process, occurring over geologic time, and indeed it is a process 
    that is essential for soil formation. 
    In the context of environmental protection, most concerns about erosion are related to 
    accelerated erosion, where the natural rate has been significantly increased mostly by 
    human activity. Accelerated erosion by running water has been identified as the most 
    severe threat to soil in Europe. 
    Severe erosion is commonly associated with the development of temporary or permanently 
    eroded channels or gullies that can fragment farmland. Such features are often the only 
    visible signs. 
    In a period of rapid change in both climate and land use, and/or in response to revised 
    agricultural policies and international markets, it is very important to be able to assess the 
    state of soil erosion at a European level, using an objective methodology. 
    This report is to accompany Special Publication Ispra 2004 No.73 – S.P.I.04.73, The 
    PESERA Map version 1 October 2003, in ISO B1 format. 
    The PESERA map shows estimated loss of soil by water erosion and it is one of the key 
    outputs from the PESERA research project. 
    The map is based on the application, at 1 km resolution, of the PESERA/RDI model that 
    estimates the rate of loss of soil material from hillsides. 
    Other forms of soil erosion caused by wind, snowmelt, undercutting of river-banks, tillage, 
    trampling by animals, land-levelling and landslides are not included. 
    There are several possible methodologies for creating an erosion map of Europe; some of 
    these are based on the collection of distributed field observations, others on an assessment 
    of factors and combinations of factors that influence erosion rates, and others primarily on 
    a modelling approach. 
    All of these methods require calibration and validation, although the type of validation 
    needed is different for each category. 
    The PESERA (Pan–European Soil Erosion Risk Assessment) model is a physically based 
    and spatial distributed model combining the effect of topography, climate and soil into a 
    single integrated forecast of runoff and soil erosion. 
    PESERA uses the simplest possible storage, or ‘bucket’ model to convert daily rainfall to 
    daily overland flow runoff. Runoff is estimated as Rainfall minus Threshold storage. The 
    threshold depends on a number of factors related to the soil, vegetation cover, tillage and 
    soil moisture status. 
    The calculations described above are performed independently for each cell within a 1 km 
    grid across Europe. 
    A pan-European calibration of erosion rates is not practicable because there are only a 
    limited number (between 50 and 100) of sites, throughout Europe, where acceptable 
    measurements of erosion rates have been made and these differ significantly in 
    methodology and scale.  Four main datasets are required to run the PESERA model, to provide essential climate, 
    soils, land cover and topographic data. 
    The MARS database (JRC) provides daily time series of rainfall, temperature and potential 
    evapotranspiration, interpolated to a 50 km grid for Europe. These data have been further 
    interpolated at 1 km resolution, using a inverse-spline mathematical procedure, to provide 
    the monthly data layers for the model. 
    The European Soil Database has been used to provide soil erodibility (converts runoff to 
    erosion rates), soil water storage capacity (maximum storage capacity of the soil before 
    runoff) and crustability (sets the lower limit of storage capacity for a crusted soil in 
    unvegetated areas), on a consistent basis at 1 km resolution across Europe. 
    Land use is based on CORINE land cover at 250 m resolution for 1989, and these data are 
    combined with cereal planting dates to provide the parameters for a crop or natural 
    vegetation growth model. 
    A 30 second (1 km) digital elevation model available from EROS has provided the 
    topographic basis for the PESERA erosion map. 
    The PESERA model has been applied at a 1 km resolution for the whole of Europe except 
    for some areas where some data are missing.  For Denmark, the PESERA map shows erosion rates that seem to be high compared with 
    southern Europe, and appear not to be related to planting dates or to crop cover.  The map shows erosion rates east of Bayonne that seem quite high compared to other 
    landscape units in France and Spain, whereas for other areas in France the erosion 
    estimates seem to fit better with local observation and/or expert judgement. 
    Estimated erosion rates are shown to be high in the northern part of the Po valley in Italy, 
    despite the fact that the land is relatively flat. In the arable areas of Umbria, Le Marche, 
    Campagne and Molise, the predicted erosion rates accord much better with observation. 
    In Spain, except for the valley of the Guadalquivir and to a lesser extent on the northern 
    Meseta, areas of high erosion are mostly small and localised with predicted soil loss rates 
    in the rest of the country probably being underestimates. 
    The PESERA map probably underestimates erosion rates on the silty soils in the Welsh 
    Borderlands (UK), and on some parts of the South Downs in southern England, but 
    revision of the land use/cover and the climate (rainfall) data might correct this. 
    Although in general it seems as if the current version of the PESERA grid model may over estimate erosion in valleys and basins where the land is arable but relatively flat, many 
    areas on the map show erosion rates coinciding with observation and measurement, for 
    example parts of the Guadalquivir and Ebro valleys in Spain, around Toulouse in southwest France, the loess belt in Belgium, the Siret catchment in north-eastern Romania, the 
    Alto-Adige (I), agricultural areas in Czech Republic and much of Slovakia. 
    In practice, no erosion map at a European scale can be based on detailed knowledge at 
    every point on the continent and it would be impossible to include every factor of local 
    importance in a comprehensive model. 
    The greatest potential for improvement in these erosion estimates from PESERA version 1, 
    lies in the use of better climate data, potentially available from national archives though not 
    normally ‘free of charge’, more detailed soil information and up-to-date land use/cover. 
    Land cover requires frequent updating, because changes in land use have a major impact 
    on erosion rates. There is the potential to do this through the analysis of remotely sensed 
    images. For future scenarios of erosion, improvements in GCMs and economic forecasts 
    offer a potential that is still far from full realisation. 
    However, by applying a common methodology throughout Europe, based on physical 
    understanding, the PESERA model is able to identify major differences between regions 
    and to highlight areas particularly at risk. 
    To date, PESERA provides the only Europe-wide estimates of soil erosion by water, that 
    are based on a harmonised approach and standard data sets. This first version of the 
    PESERA map is therefore timely in its appearance and should provide the initial basis for 
    planning policies to protect soil at the European level. 
    The possibilities for improvement in the near future look optimistic in view of the vastly 
    improved data on land use and cover together with enhanced data processing capabilities 
    that are now becoming available. 
    The next step will be to compare the PESERA estimates with national measurements and 
    risk assessments. Combining the results of such comparisons with improved data on 
    climate, soil, land use/cover and topography (DEM) should lead to improved estimates of 
    soil erosion by water for input to the forthcoming soil protection strategy for Europe.

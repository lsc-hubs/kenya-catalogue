  title: Pan-European soil erosion risk assessment, The PESERA map
  abstract: "Soil erosion is a natural process, occurring over geologic time, and\
    \ indeed it is a process \nthat is essential for soil formation. \nIn the context\
    \ of environmental protection, most concerns about erosion are related to \naccelerated\
    \ erosion, where the natural rate has been significantly increased mostly by \n\
    human activity. Accelerated erosion by running water has been identified as the\
    \ most \nsevere threat to soil in Europe. \nSevere erosion is commonly associated\
    \ with the development of temporary or permanently \neroded channels or gullies\
    \ that can fragment farmland. Such features are often the only \nvisible signs.\
    \ \nIn a period of rapid change in both climate and land use, and/or in response\
    \ to revised \nagricultural policies and international markets, it is very important\
    \ to be able to assess the \nstate of soil erosion at a European level, using\
    \ an objective methodology."

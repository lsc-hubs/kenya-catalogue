  title: A system for quantitative evaluation of the fertility of tropical soils (QUEFTS)
  abstract: |
    A system is described for a quantitative evaluation of the native fertility of tropical soils, 
    using calculated yields of unfertilized maize as a yardstick. The system is applicable to well 
    drained, deep soils, that have a pH(H20) in the range 4.5–7.0, and values for organic carbon, 
    P-Olsen and exchangeable potassium below 70 g/kg, 30 mg/kg and 30 mmol/kg, respectively (0–20 cm). 
    Soil fertility is interpreted as the capacity of a soil to provide plants with nitrogen, phosphorus 
    and potassium, but the methodology allows for including other nutrients.

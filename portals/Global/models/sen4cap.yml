  title: Sen4CAP - Sentinels for Common Agriculture Policy
  abstract: 'The Sen4CAP system is an operational standalone processing chain which generates a set of products 
    for agriculture monitoring from Sentinel-2 (S2) L1C and Landsat 8 (L8) L1T time series along the growing season. These different products consist of;
    monthly cloud-free composites of surface reflectance at 10 â€“ 20 m resolution;
    monthly dynamic cropland masks, delivered from the agricultural mid-season onwards;
    cultivated crop type maps at 10 m resolution for main crop groups, delivered twice along agricultural seasons;
    daily vegetation status maps, Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and Leaf Area Index (LAI), describing the vegetative development of crops on a 10-day basis.'

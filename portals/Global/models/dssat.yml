  title: Decision support system for agrotechnology transfer (DSSAT v3)
  abstract: "Agricultural decision makers at all levels need an increasing amount\
    \ of information to better understand the possible outcomes of their decisions\
    \ to help them develop plans and policies that meet their goals. An international\
    \ team of scientists developed a decision support system for agrotechnology transfer\
    \ (DSSAT) to estimate production, resource use, and risks associated with different\
    \ crop production practices. The DSSAT is a microcomputer software package that\
    \ contains crop-soil simulation models, data bases for weather, soil, and crops,\
    \ and strategy evaluation programs integrated with a \u2018shell\u2019 program\
    \ which is the main user interface. In this paper, an overview of the DSSAT is\
    \ given along with rationale for its design and its main limitations. Concepts\
    \ for using the DSSAT in spatial decision support systems (for site-specific farming,\
    \ farm planning, and regional policy) are presented. DSSAT provides a framework\
    \ for scientific cooperation through research to enhance its capabilities and\
    \ apply it to research questions. It also has considerable potential to help decision\
    \ makers by reducing the time and human resources required for analyzing complex\
    \ alternative decisions.\n"

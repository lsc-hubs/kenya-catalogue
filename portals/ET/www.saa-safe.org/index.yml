abstract: Ethiopia's agriculture is still characterized, for the most part, as low-input/low-output
  subsistence agriculture. The level of technology is generally basic, and productivity
  per hectare is perhaps one of the lowest in the world. Even in high agricultural
  potential areas of the country, in which crop-based systems predominate and population
  densities are highest, productivity is constrained by lack of knowledge, lack of
  finance, poor postharvest handling and poorly developed markets.From 1979/80 to
  1991/92, annual food crop production ranged between 4.87 and 7.81 million tons,
  whereas per capita food production for the same years declined from 174 kg/year
  in 1979/80 to 92 kg/year in 1991/92.

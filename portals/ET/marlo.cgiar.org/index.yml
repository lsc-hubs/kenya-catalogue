abstract: "New Ethiopian Ministry of Agriculture data sharing policy supported by\
  \ WLE/CIAT and GIZ to improve food production while building landscape health Short\
  \ outcome/impact statement: WLE/CIAT, Deutsche Gesellschaft f\xFCr Internationale\
  \ Zusammenarbeit (GIZ) and partners supported the Ethiopian Ministry of Agriculture\
  \ to adopt a comprehensive data sharing policy. Currently, data sets, for example\
  \ fertility trials, are scattered among many scientists and institutions, severely\
  \ limiting the ability to target fertilizer recommendations to farmers. This will\
  \ now change as the Ministry is working with stakeholders to collate datasets to\
  \ develop national fertilizer recommendations. This policy will undoubtedly support\
  \ the agricultural transformation agenda"

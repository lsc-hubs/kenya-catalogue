    The GMW aims to provide geospatial information about mangrove extent
    and changes to the Ramsar Convention, national wetland practitioners,
    decision makers and NGOs. It is part of the Ramsar Science and
    Technical Review Panel (STRP) work plan for 2016-2018 and a Pilot
    Project to the Ramsar Global Wetlands Observation System (GWOS),
    which is implemented under the GEO-Wetlands Initiative. The primary
    objective of the GMW has been to provide countries lacking a national
    mangrove monitoring system with first cut mangrove extent and change
    maps, to help safeguard against further mangrove forest loss and
    degradation.

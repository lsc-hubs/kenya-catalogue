  abstract: "A Digital Elevation Model (DEM) is a digital representation of Earth\u2019\
    s topography. It helps to understand the land surface characteristics in the height\
    \ dimension. It is also used as an ancillary dataset to calculate illumination\
    \ and viewing geometry of a satellite imagery. DE Africa provides access to the\
    \ Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) v 3.0 (SRTMGL1) product.\n\nThis elevation\
    \ model has a spatial resolution of 30 m and is derived from data collected by\
    \ NASA's Shuttle Radar Topography Mission in 2000.\n\nIt is provided by NASA's\
    \ Land Processes Distributed Active Archive Center (LP DAAC).\n\nFor more information,\
    \ see https://lpdaac.usgs.gov/products/srtmgl1v003/\n\nThis product is accessible\
    \ through OGC Web Service (https://ows.digitalearth.africa/), for analysis in\
    \ DE Africa Sandbox JupyterLab (https://github.com/digitalearthafrica/deafrica-sandbox-notebooks/wiki)."

  abstract: 'Time series of annual global maps of land use and land cover (LULC),
    currently available from 2017 to 2021. The maps are derived from ESA Sentinel-2
    imagery at 10m resolution. Each map is a composite of LULC predictions for 9 classes
    throughout the year in order to generate a representative snapshot of each year.


    This dataset was generated by Impact Observatory, who used billions of human-labeled
    pixels (curated by the National Geographic Society) to train a deep learning model
    for land classification. The global map was produced by applying this model to
    the Sentinel-2 annual scene collections on the Planetary Computer. Each of the
    maps has an assessed average accuracy of over 75%.

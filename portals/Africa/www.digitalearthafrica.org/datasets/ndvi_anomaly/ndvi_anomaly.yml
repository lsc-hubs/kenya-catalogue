  abstract: 'Standardised NDVI Anomalies provide a measure of vegetation health relative
    to long term average conditions by measuring the departure, in units of standard
    devaiations, away from the long-term mean. These monthly NDVI anomalies were calculated
    by combining NDVI observations from Landsat 8, Landsat 9, and Sentinel-2 for a
    given month, subtracting those values from the long term NDVI mean, then dividing
    by the long-term NDVI standard deviation. Postive values indicate vegetation is
    greener than average conditions, and are usually due to increased rainfall in
    a region. Negative values indicate additional plant stress relative to the long-term
    average.


    This service provides data monthly from January 2017 at a spatial resolution of
    30 m. The long term means and standard deviations used are available through the
    "NDVI Climatology" layer.

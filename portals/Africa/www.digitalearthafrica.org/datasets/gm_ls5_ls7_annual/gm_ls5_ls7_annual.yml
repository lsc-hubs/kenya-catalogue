  abstract: 'Individual remote sensing images can be affected by noisy data, such
    as clouds, cloud shadows, and haze. To produce cleaner images that can be compared
    more easily across time, we can create ''summary'' images or ''composites'' that
    combine multiple images into one image to reveal the median or ''typical'' appearance
    of the landscape for a certain time period.


    One approach is to create a geomedian. A geomedian is based on a high-dimensional
    statistic called the ''geometric median'' (Small 1990), which effectively trades
    a temporal stack of poor-quality observations for a single high-quality pixel
    composite with reduced spatial noise (Roberts et al. 2017). In contrast to a standard
    median, a geomedian maintains the relationship between spectral bands. This allows
    further analysis on the composite images, just as we would on the original satellite
    images (e.g. by allowing the calculation of common band indices like NDVI). An
    annual geomedian image is calculated from the surface reflectance values drawn
    from a calendar year.


    In addition, surface reflectance varabilities within the same time period can
    be measured to support characterization of the land surfaces. The median absolute
    deviation (MAD) is a robust measure (resilient to outliers) of the variability
    within a dataset. For multi-spectral Earth observation, deviation can be measured
    against the geomedian using a number of distance metrics.  Three of these metrics
    are adopted to highlight different types of changes in the landscape:

    - Euclidean distance (EMAD), which is more sensitive to changes in target brightness.

    - Cosine (spectral) distance (SMAD), which is more sensitive to changes in target
    spectral response.

    - Bray Curtis dissimilarity (BCMAD), which is more sensitive to the distribution
    of the observation values through time.


    More techincal information about the GeoMAD product can be found in the User Guide
    (https://docs.digitalearthafrica.org/en/latest/data_specs/GeoMAD_specs.html)


    This product has a spatial resolution of 30 m and is available annually from 1984
    to 2012 in selected areas.


    It is derived from USGS Collection 2, Level 2 Landsat 5 & 7 surface reflectance
    data.


    Annual geomedian images enable easy visual and algorithmic interpretation, e.g.
    understanding urban expansion, at annual intervals. They are also useful for characterising
    permanent landscape features such as woody vegetation. The MADs can be used on
    their own or together with geomedian to gain insights about the land surface,
    e.g. for land cover classificiation and for change detection from year to year.

  abstract: "Individual remote sensing images can be affected by noisy data, such\
    \ as clouds, cloud shadows, and haze. To produce cleaner images that can be compared\
    \ more easily across time, we can create 'summary' images or 'composites' that\
    \ combine multiple images into one image to reveal the median or 'typical' appearance\
    \ of the landscape for a certain time period.\n\nOne approach is to create a geomedian.\
    \ A geomedian is based on a high-dimensional statistic called the 'geometric median'\
    \ (Small 1990), which effectively trades a temporal stack of poor-quality observations\
    \ for a single high-quality pixel composite with reduced spatial noise (Roberts\
    \ et al. 2017). In contrast to a standard median, a geomedian maintains the relationship\
    \ between spectral bands. This allows further analysis on the composite images,\
    \ just as we would on the original satellite images (e.g. by allowing the calculation\
    \ of common band indices like NDVI). An semiannual geomedian image is calculated\
    \ from the surface reflectance values drawn from a 6 month period.\n\nIn addition,\
    \ surface reflectance varabilities within the same time period can be measured\
    \ to support characterization of the land surfaces. The median absolute deviation\
    \ (MAD) is a robust measure (resilient to outliers) of the variability within\
    \ a dataset. For multi-spectral Earth observation, deviation can be measured against\
    \ the geomedian using a number of distance metrics.  Three of these metrics are\
    \ adopted to highlight different types of changes in the landscape:\n- Euclidean\
    \ distance (EMAD), which is more sensitive to changes in target brightness.\n\
    - Cosine (spectral) distance (SMAD), which is more sensitive to changes in target\
    \ spectral response.\n- Bray Curtis dissimilarity (BCMAD), which is more sensitive\
    \ to the distribution of the observation values through time.\n\nMore techincal\
    \ information about the GeoMAD product can be found in the User Guide (https://docs.digitalearthafrica.org/en/latest/data_specs/GeoMAD_specs.html)\n\
    \nThis product has a spatial resolution of 10 m and is available semiannually\
    \ for 2017 to 2021 in 6 month intervals: January\u2013June and July\u2013December.\n\
    It is derived from Surface Reflectance Sentinel-2 data. This product contains\
    \ modified Copernicus Sentinel data 2017-2021.\n\nSemiannual geomedian images\
    \ and the MADs are useful for characterising landscapes with seasonal changes.\n\

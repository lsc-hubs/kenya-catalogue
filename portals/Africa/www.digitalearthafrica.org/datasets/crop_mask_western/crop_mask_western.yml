  abstract: "Digital Earth Africa's cropland extent map for Western Africa (2019)\
    \ shows the estimated location of croplands in the countries of Nigeria, Benin,\
    \ Togo, Ghana, Cote d\u2019Ivoire, Liberia, Sierra Leone, Guinea, and Guinea-Bissau\
    \ for the period January to December 2019. Cropland is defined as: \"a piece of\
    \ land of minimum 0.01 ha (a single 10m x 10m pixel) that is sowed/planted and\
    \ harvest-able at least once within the 12 months after the sowing/planting date.\"\
    \ This definition will exclude non-planted grazing lands and perennial crops which\
    \ can be difficult for satellite imagery to differentiate from natural vegetation.\n\
    \nThis provisional cropland extent map has a resolution of 10m, and was built\
    \ using Copernicus Sentinel-2 satellite images from 2019. The cropland extent\
    \ map was produced using extensive training data from Western Africa, coupled\
    \ with a Random Forest machine learning model. For a detailed exploration of the\
    \ methods used to produce the cropland extent map, read the Jupyter Notebooks\
    \ in DE Africa\u2019s crop-mask GitHub repository.\n\nAn independent validation\
    \ dataset suggests this service has an overall accuracy of 83.6 %. The algorithm\
    \ tends to report more omission errors (labelling actual crops as non-crops) than\
    \ commission errors (labelling non-crops as crops). Where commission errors occur\
    \ they tend to be focussed around wetlands and seasonal grasslands which spectrally\
    \ resemble some kinds of cropping.\n\nThe crop mask contains three measurements:\n\
    - mask (\"Cropped land\"): This band displays cropped regions as a binary map.\
    \ Values of 1 indicate the presence of crops, while a value of 0 indicates the\
    \ absence of cropping. This band is a pixel-based cropland extent map, meaning\
    \ the map displays the raw output of the pixel-based Random Forest classification.\n\
    - prob (\"Probability of cropping\"): This band displays the prediction probabilities\
    \ for the 'crop' class during 2019. As this service used a random forest classifier,\
    \ the prediction probabilities refer to the percentage of trees that voted for\
    \ the random forest classification. For example, if the model had 200 decision\
    \ trees in the random forest, and 150 of the trees voted 'crop', the prediction\
    \ probability is 150 / 200 x 100 = 75 %. Thresholding this band at 50 % will produce\
    \ a map identical to mask.\n- filtered (\"Cropped land (object-filtered)\"): This\
    \ band displays cropped regions as a binary map. Values of 1 indicate the presence\
    \ of crops, while a value of 0 indicates the absence of cropping. This band is\
    \ an object-based cropland extent map where the mask band has filtered using an\
    \ image segmentation algorithm. During this process, segments smaller than 1 Ha\
    \ (100 10m x 10m pixels) are merged with neighbouring segments, resulting in a\
    \ map where the smallest classified region is 1 Ha in size. The filtered dataset\
    \ is provided as small commission errors are removed by this process, and the\
    \ 'salt and pepper' effect typical of classifying pixels is diminished.\n\nMore\
    \ technical information about the cropland extent service can be found in the\
    \ User Guide (https://docs.digitalearthafrica.org/en/latest/data_specs/Cropland_extent_specs.html)\n\
    \nCropland extent maps are a foundational, baseline layer in high-order crop health\
    \ and crop productivity products which necessarily rely on knowing where cropping\
    \ occurs before further analysis can take place.\n\nThis service is accessible\
    \ through OGC Web Service (https://ows.digitalearth.africa/), for analysis in\
    \ DE Africa Sandbox JupyterLab (https://github.com/digitalearthafrica/deafrica-sandbox-notebooks/wiki)\

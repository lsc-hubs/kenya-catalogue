  abstract: 'The Copernicus DEM is a Digital Surface Model (DSM) which represents
    the surface of the Earth including buildings, infrastructure and vegetation. This
    DSM is derived from an edited DSM named WorldDEM, where flattening of water bodies
    and consistent flow of rivers has been included. In addition, editing of shore-
    and coastlines, special features such as airports, and implausible terrain structures
    has also been applied.


    he WorldDEM product is based on the radar satellite data acquired during the TanDEM-X
    Mission, which is funded by a Public Private Partnership between the German State,
    represented by the German Aerospace Centre (DLR) and Airbus Defence and Space.
    OpenTopography is providing access to the global 30m (GLO-30) DSM through the
    public AWS S3 bucket established by Sinergise.

  abstract: 'Fractional cover describes the landscape in terms of coverage by green
    vegetation, non-green vegetation (including deciduous trees during autumn, dry
    grass, etc.) and bare soil. It provides insight into how areas of dry vegetation
    and/or bare soil and green vegetation are changing over time.


    This product has a spatial resolution of 30 m and a temporal coverage of 1980s
    to current. It is derived from Landsat Collection 2 Surface Reflectance product.


    Fractional cover allows users to understand the large scale patterns and trends
    and inform evidence based decision making and policy on topics including wind
    and water erosion risk, soil carbon dynamics, land surface process monitoring,
    land management practices, vegetation studies, fuel load estimation, ecosystem
    modelling, and rangeland condition.


    The fractional cover algorithm was developed by the Joint Remote Sensing Research
    Program: http://data.auscover.org.au/xwiki/bin/view/Product+pages/Landsat+Seasonal+Fractional+Cover

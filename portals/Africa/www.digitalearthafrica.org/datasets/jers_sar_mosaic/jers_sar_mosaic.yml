  abstract: "Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data have been shown to provide different\
    \ and complementary information to the more common optical remote sensing data.\
    \ Radar backscatter response is a function of topography, land cover structure,\
    \ orientation, and moisture characteristics\u2014including vegetation biomass\u2014\
    and the radar signal can penetrate clouds, providing information about the earth\u2019\
    s surface where optical sensors cannot. Digital Earth Africa provides access to\
    \ Normalized Radar Backscatter data, for which Radiometric Terrain Correction\
    \ (RTC) has been applied so data acquired with different imaging geometries over\
    \ the same region can be compared.\nThe JERS annual mosaic is generated from images\
    \ acquired by the SAR sensor on the Japanese Earth Resources Satellite-1 (JERS-1)\
    \ satellite.\n\nThis product contains radar measurement in L-band and HH polarization.\
    \ It has a spatial resolution of 25 m and is available for 1996. Data is provided\
    \ as digital number (DN), which can be converted to backscatter in decibel unit\
    \ using 10*log10(\U0001D437\U0001D441^2)-84.66.\n\nIt is part of a global dataset\
    \ provided by the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) Earth Observation\
    \ Research Center.\n\nFor more information on the product, see https://www.eorc.jaxa.jp/ALOS/en/palsar_fnf/fnf_index.htm\n\
    \nThis product is accessible through OGC Web Service (https://ows.digitalearth.africa/),\
    \ for analysis in DE Africa Sandbox JupyterLab (https://github.com/digitalearthafrica/deafrica-sandbox-notebooks/wiki)\
    \ and for direct download from AWS S3 (https://data.digitalearth.africa/)."

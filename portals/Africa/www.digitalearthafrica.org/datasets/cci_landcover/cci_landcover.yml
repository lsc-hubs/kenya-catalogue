  abstract: 'As part of the ESA Climate Change Initiative (CCI), the Land Cover project
    is concerned with the generation of the land cover ECV. Land cover is defined
    as the physical material at the surface of the earth. Land covers include grass,
    asphalt, trees, bare ground, water, etc.


    The project''s objective is to critically revisit all algorithms required for
    the generation of a global land product in the light of GCOS requirements, and
    to design and demonstrate a prototype system delivering in a consistent way over
    years and from various EO instruments global land cover information matching the
    needs of key users'' belonging to the climate change community. The focus is placed
    on the ESA and Member States missions providing near daily global surface reflectance
    observation at moderate spatial resolution (MERIS FR & RR, SPOT VEGETATION) but
    the contribution of ESA SAR sensors will also be investigated to tackle specific
    land cover discrimination issue.

  abstract: "The Land Portal Foundation believes that access to information is
    crucial for achieving good land governance and securing land rights for
    landless and vulnerable people. Improving access to land-related data and
    information is our mission. This is what we do:     Provide a platform for
    land data, publications, news, blogs, multimedia content and much more from
    an international network of organizations and institutions. Aggregating
    diverse and highly dispersed content helps to make hidden data available to
    everyone.  Nurture the information ecosystem by linking land databases,
    bringing fragmented data collections together and enriching content with
    metadata that complies with Open Data standards and principles. Fostering a
    healthy and diverse ecosystem of land-related information helps to improve
    the potential impact of data and ensures information is easily searchable
    and discoverable.  Stimulate debate among those working on land-related
    issues around the world through events, discussions and webinars. Online and
    offline dialogues help raise awareness of hidden issues (e.g. sexual
    extortion in the land sector) and provide opportunities for collaboration
    between diverse groups and organizations.  Visualize and synthesize data
    from diverse sources into unique portfolios of contextualized and actionable
    land governance information. Our thematic and country portfolios provide
    free virtual repositories of bibliographic and multimedia resources, helping
    to reveal new trends and expose existing gaps in the information
    landscape.  Support information providers from the land sector to utilize
    Open Data standards and encourage the creation and uptake of a
    standards-based data infrastructure based upon FAIR (Findable, Accessible,
    Interoperable and Reusable) principles. The increased adoption of commonly
    agreed data standards is helping information derived from local groups,
    national organizations and international institutions to coexist within the
    wider information ecosystem.  Explain and monitor indicators on land
    governance including the Sustainable Development Goals, the Voluntary
    Guidelines on the Responsible Governance of Tenure (VGGTs) and other
    international/regional frameworks for land monitoring. Showcasing and
    examining land monitoring instruments is helping to raise awareness and
    increase uptake of key indicators."

  title: Biophysical baseline assessment in eastern Rwanda using the LDSF
  abstract: 'The LDSF was developed by World Agroforestry (ICRAF) in response to the
    need for consistent field methods and indicator frameworks to assess ecosystem
    health across landscapes. The LDSF measures multiple key indicators of land and
    soil health in order to understand drivers of degradation, as well as monitor
    changes over time (http://landscapeportal.org/blog/2015/03/25/the-land-degradation-surveillance-framework-ldsf/).
    The framework was applied within the Regreening Africa project: https://regreeningafrica.org/
    and has been applied in projects across the global tropics. This project will
    benefit from existing data in the LDSF database, while at the same time contributing
    to these critically important global datasets through on-going data collection.
    This project contains data collected from two 100-km2 LDSF sites in eastern Rwanda
    in September and November 2018. Read the blog here: https://regreeningafrica.org/project-updates/using-the-land-degradation-surveillance-framework-to-assess-land-health-in-rwanda/'

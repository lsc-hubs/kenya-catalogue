  title: Dataset for the evaluation of forest and landscape restoration in Northern
    Ethiopia
  abstract: "This dataset was used to apply the Stochastic Impact Evaluation (SIE)\
    \ framework in the simulation of returns on investment in biophysical and socio-economic\
    \ interventions. The study was carried out in a degraded dry Afromontane forest\
    \ in northern Ethiopia. We used an expert knowledge elicitation approach to acquire\
    \ the data from decision-makers and community stakeholders. We also developed\
    \ a probabilistic model of the decision\u2019s costs and benefits while accounting\
    \ for risks and uncertainties and projected outcomes over time. The data shared\
    \ here captures all the parameters considered important in the impact pathway\
    \ (i.e. the expected benefits, costs, and risks) of the decision. The data can\
    \ be used to examine the impact of Forest Landscape Restoration (FLR) projects\
    \ on livelihoods as well as landscapes."

  title: No changes in soil organic carbon and nitrogen following long term prescribed
    burning and livestock exclusion in the Sudan savanna woodlands of Burkina Faso
  abstract: This study was done to study the impact of grazing and fire on soil Carbon
    stocks. It was part of a long-term split-plot experiment established in 1992 to
    explore the ecological impacts of prescribed fire and grazing intensity. It analyzed
    the effects of 19 years of prescribed annual burning and livestock exclusion on
    tree density, SOC and TN concentrations in the Sudanian savanna ecoregion at two
    sites (Tiogo and Laba) in Burkina Faso. The study was conducted in partnership
    with Environmental Institute for Agricultural Research (INERA) and International
    Livestock Research Institute (ILRI). It was supported by the GIZ/BEAF International
    Agricultural Research Grants Programme; and Water Land and Ecosystems program
    of the CGIAR. The study contributed to the Carbon sequestration options in pastoral
    agro-pastoral systems in Africa project.

  title: Biophysical Soil and Land Health Assessment in the Gambia
  abstract: "The Land Degradation Surveillance Framework (LDSF) survey was a collaborative\
    \ effort among a number of national universities, government technical services,\
    \ national soil and forestry departments, research institutions and soil laboratories.\
    \ Field teams spent about five weeks in the field observing vegetation conditions,\
    \ land use, and visible erosion and taking soil samples. Soil samples were analyzed\
    \ for a suite of physical and chemical properties. Analyses of these data were\
    \ designed to provide an understanding of the landscape status based on easily\
    \ discernible characteristics, particularly by site. The analysis also provides\
    \ spatially explicit analysis of these findings as digital maps that can be used\
    \ to provide very site-specific information on the health of soil and vegetation\
    \ throughout the three LDSF sites. The aim was to provide some generalizable key\
    \ problems and straightforward management recommendations. The field surveys took\
    \ place in February 2021, with three field team working simultaneously. These\
    \ surveys were led by the ICRAF team in Gambia in collaboration with the soil\
    \ and forestry departments. The LDSF field training and data collection was led\
    \ by ICRAF national team in Gambia, while the soil and forest departments of Gambia\
    \ provided logistics support during the field work and data collection. This activity\
    \ was conducted by World Agroforestry (ICRAF) as an output of the project, \u2018\
    Large-Scale Ecosystem-Based Adaptation in The Gambia River Basin: Developing a\
    \ Climate Resilient, Natural Resource-Based Economy\u2019. The project is funded\
    \ by the Green Climate Fund and implemented by the Government of The Gambia with\
    \ the support of United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP). In total, 474 plots\
    \ of 1000 m2 were sampled: 160 plots in Changai, 158 plots in Dumboto and 156\
    \ plots in Gambisarra."

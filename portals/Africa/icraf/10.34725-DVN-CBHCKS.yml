  title: Biophysical baseline assessment within the KCEP-CRAL action areas in Kenya,
    using the LDSF
  abstract: These data were collected within the Kenya Cereal Enhancement Programme-Climate
    Resilient Agricultural Livelihoods (KCEP-CRAL) Window. This study was conducted
    within the action sites of the Kenya Cereal Enhancement Programme-Climate Resilient
    Agricultural Livelihoods (KCEP-CRAL) Window, which is a programme supported by
    the Government of Kenya and International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD)
    within the Adaptation for Smallholder Agriculture Programme (ASAP). The project
    assessed key indicators of land and soil health in order to understand drivers
    of degradation, and monitor changes over time using the Land Degradation Surveillance
    Framework (LDSF) methodology (http://landscapeportal.org/blog/2015/03/25/the-land-degradation-surveillance-framework-ldsf/).
    The LDSF provides a field protocol for measuring indicators of the "health" of
    an ecosystem. The LDSF was developed by the World Agroforestry (ICRAF) in response
    to the need for consistent field methods and indicator frameworks to assess land
    health in landscapes. The framework has been applied in projects across the global
    tropics, and is currently one of the largest land health databases globally with
    more than 30,000 observations, shared at http://landscapeportal.org. This project
    will benefit from existing data in the LDSF database, while at the same time contributing
    to these critically important global datasets through on-going data collection.
    Earth Observation (EO) data will be combined with the LDSF framework to develop
    the outputs for the project, including land degradation and soil health. Specific
    Activities on the ICRAF Component as Stated in the Agreement 1. Develop survey
    methodology detailing study design, methodology, tools, work plan and timelines
    documented 2. Procure LDSF field survey equipment 3. Conduct five LDSF surveys
    across the KCEP-CRAL action areas 4. Process, analyse and document the soil samples
    5. Conduct Earth Observation-based assessment of biophysical indicators over time
    6. Conduct capacity development opportunities with members of the PCU M staff
    and Government counterparts on LDSF field methodology This dataset contains LDSF
    field data from five LDSF sites in Kenya totalling 787 LDSF plots . It also contains
    the predictions using MIR Spectroscopy for 1500 Topsoil (0-20cm) and Subsoil (20-50cm)
    samples for six soil variables, including soil organic carbon, total nitrogen
    and pH.

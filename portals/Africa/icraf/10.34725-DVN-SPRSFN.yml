  title: 'Soil Spectra and Wet Chemistry Measurements from ICRAF Soil-Plant Spectral
    Diagnostics Laboratory and Rothamsted Research: Africa Soil Information Service
    (AfSIS) Phase 2 Project Data 2014-2018 - GhaSIS'
  abstract: AfSIS Phase 2 was a collaborative project funded by the Bill and Melinda
    Gates Foundation (BMGF). Partners included, Columbia Global Center Africa (CGCA),
    Earth Institute (EI), International Soil Reference and Information Centre (ISRIC),
    The Council for Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR) for Ghana, Kwame Nkrumah
    University of Science and Technology, Rothamsted Research (RRes) and World Agroforestry
    (ICRAF). The project aimed to assist national programs in four African countries
    (Ethiopia, Ghana, Nigeria and Tanzania) to transition to modern agricultural research
    and data collection practices that were expected to result in faster agricultural
    development cycles. In Ghana a total of 3,433 soil samples were collected at two
    sampling depths (0-20cm, 20-50cm) from Nov 2015 to Aug 2016. All the soil samples
    were scanned using a ZnSe Alpha I spectrometer at the Soil Research Institute
    of the Council of Science and Industrial Research (CSIR), Kumasi, Ghana. A subset
    of 210 soil samples was shipped to ICRAF Soil-Plant Spectral Diagnostics Laboratory
    and scanned on two spectrometers (HTS-xt and ZnSe Alpha I). The same 210 soil
    samples were also sent to RRes for wet chemistry analysis. The spectra data scanned
    at CSIR (using ZnSe Alpha I) and that scanned at ICRAF Nairobi (using HTS-xt Tensor
    27) and wetchem data (analyzed at RRes) are available on Dataverse here.

  title: Dataset for supporting the net agronomic assessment of yield limiting factors
    in maize production in Machakos county, Kenya
  abstract: This dataset is used for a holistic analysis of the costs, benefits, and
    risks of on-farm soil and plant health management. The dataset was produced in
    2017 by a combination of field measurements and farmer surveys. It was collected
    for a research study aimed at identifying and testing accurate, consistent, and
    cost-effective measurement tools and methodologies for evaluating the outcomes
    of agricultural projects. Soils data was analysed by wet spectral methods to generate
    estimates of the Nitrogen (N), Phosphorus (K), and Potassium (P) levels in the
    soils which was then used as inputs for a stochastic crop production model. The
    decision model consisted of two main sections targeting interactions between biotic
    factors (rainfall variability, availability of soil nutrients, risk of drought
    and temperature) and abiotic factors (farm management practices/intensity of farm
    management). With the two datasets, we ran a risk-return model to project the
    productivity of maize production and highlight yield-limiting factors. The project
    was funded by Bill Melinda Gates Foundation and TechnoServe under the Innovation
    in Outcome Measurement (IOM) program

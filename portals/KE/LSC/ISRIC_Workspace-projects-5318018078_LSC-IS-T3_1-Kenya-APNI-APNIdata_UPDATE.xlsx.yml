  title: Feed the crop, not the soil! Explaining variability in maize yield responses
    to nutrient applications in smallholder farms of western Kenya
  abstract: 'This file contains soil data from the African Plant Nutrition Institute
    (APNI), collected by Samuel Njoroge and provided to ISRIC (see data sharing agreement).
    Sampling locations are in Western Kenya (Siaya country), sampling depth was 0-20
    cm. Data are described in:  S Njoroge Kinyanjui (2019) Feed the crop, not the
    soil! Explaining variability in maize yield responses to nutrient applications
    in smallholder farms of western Kenya. PhD thesis, Wageningen University. Day
    0: Data collected before field trials were implemented, Day 7: Soil data belong
    to control treatments (no application of nutrients)

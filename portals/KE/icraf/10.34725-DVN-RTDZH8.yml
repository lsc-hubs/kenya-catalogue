  title: Evidence-based Soils Agronomy for Sustainable Crop Production in Muranga
    County, Kenya
  abstract: "The project \u2018Improved Agricultural Measurement for Evidence-based\
    \ Investments in Improved Crop Production in Kenya\u2019 was funded by The Nature\
    \ Conservancy. The project used soil-plant diagnostic method developed at the\
    \ World Agroforestry (ICRAF) to quantify soil health constraints for maize production\
    \ and targeting interventions to improve soil health for agronomic gain. We tested\
    \ soil and maize plant tissues to estimate macro and micronutrients and compared\
    \ it with optimum plant nutrient requirements. The project was piloted in in Muranga\
    \ County, Kenya.The Nature Conservancy (TNC) project dataset contains laboratory\
    \ results of 524 top (0-20 cm) and sub soil (20-50 cm) soil and 206 plant tissue\
    \ properties. The samples are from targeted 170 farms in Nginda, Kambiti in Maragua\
    \ sub county and Kangema and Kigumo sub-counties in Muranga county of Kenya in\
    \ East Africa. The datasets include MIR spectra, plant macronutrients and micronutrients\
    \ measured at the World Agroforestry (ICRAF) Soil and Plant Spectral Diagnostic\
    \ Laboratory and extracatable nutrients results from Crop Nutrition Laboratory\
    \ Services."

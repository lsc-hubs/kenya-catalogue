  title: 'Wet chemistry data for a subset of AfSIS: Phase I archived soil samples'
  abstract: "This dataset contains a subset of the samples collected during the AfSIS\
    \ Phase I project and was a collaborative effort between World Agroforestry (ICRAF)\
    \ and Rothamsted Research. The soil samples were retrieved from ICRAF Soil Archive:\
    \ https://worldagroforestry.org/output/icraf-soil-archive-physical-archive-systematically-collected-soil-samples\
    \ and subject to wet chemical analysis at Rothamsted Research in the UK under\
    \ a Global Challenges Research Fund project, \"BBS/OS/GC/000014B: Chemical and\
    \ Biological Assessment of AfSIS soils\" funded through the UK Biotechnology and\
    \ Biological Sciences Research Council. This dataset includes the Site, Cluster,\
    \ Plot as well as the GPS coordinates and wet chemistry data from 2002 samples\
    \ collected from 18 countries and 51 LDSF sites. The original data collection\
    \ was part of the AfSIS Phase I project, funded by the Bill and Melinda Gates\
    \ Foundation (BMGF) and took place between 2009-2013. ICRAF and CIAT contributed\
    \ the Site, Cluster, Plot and GPS coordinates for the soil samples, ICRAF organized\
    \ the sub-sampling of the soil samples from the ICRAF physical archive in Nairobi\
    \ and Rothamsted analysed the soil samples in the UK in 2017 and 2018. Visit our\
    \ websites here: https://worldagroforestry.org/landhealth and https://www.rothamsted.ac.uk/.\
    \ The AfSIS Phase I project funded by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation (BMGF)\
    \ from 2009-2013, aimed to provide a consistent baseline of soil information across\
    \ sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). Led by CIAT-TSBF, partners included: ISRIC, CIESIN,\
    \ The Earth Institute at Columbia University and World Agroforestry (ICRAF). ICRAF\
    \ led the systematic assessments of soil health using the Land Degradation Surveillance\
    \ Framework (LDSF), which was developed at ICRAF, http://landscapeportal.org/blog/2015/03/25/the-land-degradation-surveillance-framework-ldsf/.\
    \ LDSF sites were randomized using spatial stratification based on Koeppen-Geiger\
    \ Climate zones across 19 countries in SSA. In total 60 LDSF sites were sampled.\
    \ Soil samples were collected using the LDSF at two depths, 0-20 cm (labelled\
    \ Topsoil) and 20-50 cm (labelled Subsoil). In each LDSF site, approximately 320\
    \ standard soil samples were collected. All of these were also scanned using MIR\
    \ Spectroscopy and are available on Dataverse here: V\xE5gen, Tor-Gunnar;Winowiecki,\

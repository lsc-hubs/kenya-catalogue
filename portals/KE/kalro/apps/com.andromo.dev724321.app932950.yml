  title: KALRO Tea Seedling
  abstract: 'Establishing a tea nursery whether for sale or for own plantings requires
    meticulous planning so that the plants are ready for transplanting or sale at
    the right time. Lack of planning may result in plants being ready for transplanting
    in the off planting season, causing losses where transplants die or there are
    no customers to purchase the plants.

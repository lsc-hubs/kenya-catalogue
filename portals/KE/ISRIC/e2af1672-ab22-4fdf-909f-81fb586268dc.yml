  title: SOTER-based soil parameter estimates (SOTWIS) for Upper Tana river catchment,
    Kenya
  abstract: "This harmonized set of soil parameter estimates for the Upper Tana river\
    \ catchment, Kenya. The data set was derived from the 1:250 000 scale Soil and\
    \ Terrain Database for the Upper Tana (SOTER_UT, ver. 1.1; Dijkshoorn et al. 2011)\
    \ and the ISRIC-WISE soil profile database, using standardized taxonomy-based\
    \ pedotransfer (taxotransfer) procedures. \n\nThe land surface of the Upper Tana,\
    \ Kenya, covering some 18,900 km2, has been mapped in SOTER using 191 unique SOTER\
    \ units. Each map unit may comprise of up to three different soil components.\
    \ In so far as possible, each soil component has been characterized by a regionally\
    \ representative profile, selected and classified by national soil experts. Conversely,\
    \ in the absence of any measured legacy data, soil components were characterized\
    \ using synthetic profiles for which only the FAO-Unesco (1988) classification\
    \ is known.\n\nSoil components in SOTER_UT have been characterized using 146 profiles\
    \ consisting of 109 real and 37 so-called synthetic profiles. The latter were\
    \ used to represent some 18% per cent of the study area. Comprehensive sets of\
    \ measured attribute data are seldom available for most profiles (109) collated\
    \ in SOTER_UT, as these were not considered in the source materials. Consequently,\
    \ to permit modelling, gaps in the soil analytical data have been filled using\
    \ consistent taxotransfer procedures. Modal soil property estimates necessary\
    \ to populate the taxotransfer procedure were derived from statistical analyses\
    \ of soil profiles held in the ISRIC-WISE database. The current taxotransfer procedure\
    \ only considers profiles in WISE that: (a) have FAO soil unit names (43) identical\
    \ to those mapped for the Upper Tana in SOTER, and (b) originate from regions\
    \ having similar K\xF6ppen climate zones (n= 5745). \n\nProperty estimates are\
    \ presented for 18 soil variables by soil unit for fixed depth intervals of 0.2\
    \ m to 1 m depth: organic carbon, total nitrogen, pH(H2O), CECsoil, CECclay, base\
    \ saturation, effective CEC, aluminium saturation, CaCO3 content, gypsum content,\
    \ exchangeable sodium percentage (ESP), electrical conductivity (ECe), bulk density,\
    \ content of sand, silt and clay, content of coarse fragments (less than 2 mm),\
    \ and volumetric water content (-33 kPa to -1.5 MPa). These attributes have been\
    \ identified as being useful for agro-ecological zoning, land evaluation, crop\
    \ growth simulation, modelling of soil carbon stocks and change, and studies of\
    \ global environmental change. \n\nThe soil property estimates can be linked to\
    \ the spatial data (map), using GIS, through the unique SOTER-unit code; database\
    \ applications should consider the full map unit composition and depth range."

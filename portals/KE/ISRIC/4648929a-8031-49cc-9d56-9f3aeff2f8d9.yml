  title: SOTER-based soil parameter estimates (SOTWIS) for Kenya
  abstract: 'This harmonized set of soil parameter estimates for Kenya (KENSOTER),
    at scale 1:1M, compiled by the Kenya Soil Survey. The land surface of the Republic
    of Kenya - excluding lakes and towns - has been characterized using 397 unique
    SOTER units corresponding with 623 soil components. The major soils have been
    described using 495 profiles, which include 178 synthetic profiles, selected by
    national soil experts as being representative for these units. The associated
    soil analytical data have been derived from soil survey reports and expert knowledge.
    Gaps in the measured soil profile data have been filled using a step-wise procedure
    which includes three main stages: (1) collate additional measured soil analytical
    data where available; (2) fill gaps using expert knowledge and common sense; (3)
    fill the remaining gaps using a scheme of taxotransfer rules.


    Parameter estimates are presented by soil unit for fixed depth intervals of 0.2
    m to 1 m depth for: organic carbon, total nitrogen, pH(H2O), CECsoil, CECclay,
    base saturation, effective CEC, aluminum saturation, CaCO3 content, gypsum content,
    exchangeable sodium percentage (ESP), electrical conductivity of saturated paste
    (ECe), bulk density, content of sand, silt and clay, content of coarse fragments,
    and available water capacity. These attributes have been identified as being useful
    for agro-ecological zoning, land evaluation, crop growth simulation, modelling
    of soil carbon stocks and change, and analyses of global environmental change.
    The current parameter estimates should be seen as best estimates based on the
    current selection of soil profiles and data clustering procedure. Taxotransfer
    rules have been flagged to provide an indication of the possible confidence in
    the derived data. Results are presented as summary files and can be linked to
    the 1:1M scale SOTER map for Kenya in a GIS, through the unique SOTER-unit code.
    The secondary data are considered appropriate for studies at the national scale
    (1:1M). Correlation of soil analytical data, however, should be done more rigorously
    when more detailed scientific work is considered.'

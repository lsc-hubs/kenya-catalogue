  abstract: "Agriculture contributes about 26% directly to the Gross Domestic Product\
    \ (GDP) and a further 25% indirectly through linkages with agro-based and associated\
    \ industries. Thus the agricultural sector is a major driver of Kenya\u2019s economy\
    \ and livelihood for the majority of the population. The sector accounts for 65%\
    \ of the national total exports and provides more than 70% of informal employment\
    \ in the rural areas. It is estimated that the sector on average contributed 1.17%\
    \ GDP growth in the overall economy between 2010 and 2016. The country\u2019s\
    \ Vision 2030 has set a target to increase growth in agricultural output by a\
    \ sustained 7% and above per year in order to propel the national economic growth\
    \ to 10% per annum. Improvements in total factor productivity are expected to\
    \ contribute to about 3% of agricultural productivity, with the remainder coming\
    \ from increased investments. The increase in productivity will not only ensure\
    \ that the government achieves targets set by the Vision 2030 but also the East\
    \ African Community (EAC) Vision 2050, Africa Union\u2019s Agenda 2063 and the\
    \ Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The objective of the Strategic Plan is\
    \ to ensure that through collaborative efforts, agricultural and livestock research\
    \ contributes to accelerated growth in total factor productivity through generation\
    \ of technologies, innovation and knowledge\n\n"

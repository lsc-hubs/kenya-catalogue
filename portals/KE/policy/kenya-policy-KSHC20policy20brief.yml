  title: 'Soil Health Research and Development in Kenya; Challenges, Opportunities
    and Policy Options

    '
  abstract: 'Agricultural production has stagnated over the years in Kenya while food
    consumption continues to increase with increasing population. The stagnation of
    agricultural production is as a result of poor soil health, driven by inadequate
    use of Integrated Soil Fertility Management (ISFM) inputs and innovations, poor
    extension service and uncoordinated research and development programmes leading
    to low adoption of ISFM innovations. While excellent progress has been made in
    improved seeds and planting materials and crop pests and diseases control, limited
    access to and low adoption of ISFM innovations has continued to hinder achievement
    of optimal agricultural production. The analysis in this policy brief recommends:
    Improvement of access to and adoption of ISFM innovations through appropriate
    government policies that would ensure availability and affordability of ISFM inputs
    through support of relevant supply markets

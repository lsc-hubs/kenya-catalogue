KALRO strategic plan;2017-2021;Agriculture contributes about 26% directly to the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and a further 25% indirectly through linkages with agro-based and associated industries. Thus the agricultural sector is a major driver of Kenya’s economy and livelihood for the majority of the population. The sector accounts for 65% of the national total exports and provides more than 70% of informal employment in the rural areas. It is estimated that the sector on average contributed 1.17% GDP growth in the overall economy between 2010 and 2016. The country’s Vision 2030 has set a target to increase growth in agricultural output by a sustained 7% and above per year in order to propel the national economic growth to 10% per annum. Improvements in total factor productivity are expected to contribute to about 3% of agricultural productivity, with the remainder coming from increased investments. The increase in productivity will not only ensure that the government achieves targets set by the Vision 2030 but also the East African Community (EAC) Vision 2050, Africa Union’s Agenda 2063 and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The objective of the Strategic Plan is to ensure that through collaborative efforts, agricultural and livestock research contributes to accelerated growth in total factor productivity through generation of technologies, innovation and knowledge;https://www.kalro.org/sites/default/files/strategic-Plan-KALRO-2017-2021.pdf;Kalro

"Soil Health Research and Development in Kenya; Challenges, Opportunities and Policy Options";2014;Agricultural production has stagnated over the years in Kenya while food consumption continues to increase with increasing population. The stagnation of agricultural production is as a result of poor soil health, driven by inadequate use of Integrated Soil Fertility Management (ISFM) inputs and innovations, poor extension service and uncoordinated research and development programmes leading to low adoption of ISFM innovations. While excellent progress has been made in improved seeds and planting materials and crop pests and diseases control, limited access to and low adoption of ISFM innovations has continued to hinder achievement of optimal agricultural production. The analysis in this policy brief recommends: Improvement of access to and adoption of ISFM innovations through appropriate government policies that would ensure availability and affordability of ISFM inputs through support of relevant supply markets;https://www.kalro.org/kalroknowledgebank/factsheets/KSHC%20policy%20brief%204-FINAL-210115.pdf);Kalro

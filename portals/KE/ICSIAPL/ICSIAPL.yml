  title: Integrated & Climate Smart Innovation for Agropastoralist Economies and Landscapes In Kenyaâ€™s ASALs
  abstract: "To address these challenges, SNV partnered with KALRO to implement this project whose main objective is to enhance the livelihoods of agro-pastoralist communities through improved forage production and livestock husbandry, building on the commercialisation of climate-smart innovations and sustainable landscape management in the three counties. To achieve this goal, the project takes a holistic approach focusing on three interlinked outcomes or pathways to ensure long-term change."

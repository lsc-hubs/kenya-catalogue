http://www.igad.int/about/;IGAD;Global;CSW;The IGAD 2021-2025 Strategy sets the strategic framework for priority interventions over the first five year for the implementation of IGAD Vision 2050. It builds on a number of on-going Programmes established to develop resilient ecosystems and economic growth. The programmes include IGAD Drought Disaster Resilience and Sustainability Initiative (IDDRSI), regional CAADP Compact, Institutional Strengthening Action Programme (ISAP), Agriculture, Livestock, Fisheries and Food Security, Natural Resources and Environmental Protection, Regional Economic Cooperation and Integration, Social Development, Peace and Security, Gender Affairs, and other strategies and policy papers which underpin the IGAD regional programmes.;https://geonode.igad.int/catalogue/csw?request=GetCapabilities&service=CSW&version=2.0.2

Currently, data sets, for example fertility trials, are scattered among many scientists and institutions, severely limiting the ability to target fertilizer recommendations to farmers. This will now change as the Ministry is working with stakeholders to collate datasets to develop national fertilizer recommendations. This policy will undoubtedly support the agricultural transformation agenda;

https://cgspace.cgiar.org/handle/10568/82824;Towards understanding fertilizer responses in Ethiopia;ET;;This is a comprehensive dataset specifically on crop response to fertilizers and is obtained from published journal articles, thesis and proceedings spanning at least 5 decades. It represents all the agriculturally productive regions of Ethiopia. The data contains information on region, crop type and soil type under which experiments were conducted, as well as application rates of nutrients (N, P, K, and other nutrients) as well as yields of the control and fertilized treatment on which crop response ratios are derived.;
https://www.saa-safe.org/www/ethiopia.html;SASAKAWA;ET;;Ethiopia's agriculture is still characterized, for the most part, as low-input/low-output subsistence agriculture. The level of technology is generally basic, and productivity per hectare is perhaps one of the lowest in the world. Even in high agricultural potential areas of the country, in which crop-based systems predominate and population densities are highest, productivity is constrained by lack of knowledge, lack of finance, poor postharvest handling and poorly developed markets.From 1979/80 to 1991/92, annual food crop production ranged between 4.87 and 7.81 million tons, whereas per capita food production for the same years declined from 174 kg/year in 1979/80 to 92 kg/year in 1991/92.;

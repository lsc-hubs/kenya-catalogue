# desira dataset inventarisation

At this repo we keep a listing of relevant portals and datasets for the desira project

The original [list](portals.csv) has been imported from an excel sheet created by Johan.

A crawl.py script is available which takes this list as a source and extracts as much info as possible from remote sources.

Users can then move into the generated metadata files to add relevant content.

Finally this content will be exported to a set of iso19139 xml files which are loaded in a catalog to provide a searchable interface
